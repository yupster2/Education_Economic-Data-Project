# Education_Economic-Data-Project
Extract
Our analysis will focus on education and economic data.  We will explore economic characteristics relating to educational institutions from grade-level, housing and school district lenses.  We will also perform spatial analyses on the data.  We hope to uncover patterns related to urban vs rural areas, areas exhibiting exponential population growth, as well as the impact of affluence and poverty on highest level of schooling attained by households.
